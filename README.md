# Welcome to my portfolio/resume repo

I have recently mastered the skills to be a professional web developer through the ultra-selective App Academy and I am ready to contribute on day one to a wide range of technologies.  I have had the pleasure of learning from former Google employees, venture capitalists, and a whole bunch of other great entrepreneurs and coders.

I have a mechanical engineering background and love heat transfer, but now I’m excited about transferring JSON data to your API.  I am passionate about finding the most concise solution to your problem to help bootstrap your project and bring your MVP to market.  I’m proficient in both front-end JavaScript and CSS as well as back-end Ruby on Rails and API architecture.  I will strive to not only complete the task, but also clearly document and communicate the logic and path taken to the finished product.

One of my portfolio apps, www.carbonfootprint.co, uses AngularJS and Ruby on Rails to track your carbon footprint as you make a more sustainable lifestyle.  Before that, I engineered an app using Backbone.js for a social venture, www.freefundraise.com; two entrepreneurs who wanted to use affiliate dollars to help children, oceans and forests.  In my most current paid work, which uses the Ruby-based Volt framework, www.voltframework.com, I was assigned the task of mastering this new technology; solving problems for which no Stack Overflow posts exist.

Please feel free to contact me if you want to take your company to the next level!

Sincerely, 

Max Plomer

<b>Raspberry Pi based GoPRO: </b><br>

I am also have a proof of concept for a project that involves using a 3D printer to print a waterproof Raspberry Pi case that holds the Pi unit, camera, as well as a battery and wires to connect to a button that activates the time-lapse photo command.  I use crontab to run a python script at start up, which waits for a voltage change indicated by a button being pressed.  The trick is that the time-lapse photo command is actually sent when the button is released, because I have built in that if you hold the button down for 5 seconds then the computer turns itself off.  

The pseudo-code for the algorithm is as follows:

    The code scans the GPIO port every 1/10 of a second to see if button is being pressed.  

      If pressed:
        1 is added to button_counter
        the variable take_photo is set to 1
        If button_counter exceeds 50, the command “sudo shutdown –h now” is sent to the system
  
      If NOT pressed:
        button_counter is set to zero
        if take_photo equals one, then we set it to zero, and send command to system to run time lapse command.

- <a href="https://gist.github.com/maxplomer/63bbd806a568b28a6fdb">button python code</a> - This is the code that is attach to the raspberry pi's crontab so that it runs at startup

<b>Unity3d Game - Predator Drone Tactics: </b><br>

<a href="https://github.com/maxplomer/engineering_projects/blob/master/unity3d/demo.zip?raw=true">Download Demo</a>
 
- I created the user interface for a turn-based Unity3d game.  Created a system where as you can move your character by clicking on cubes that represent points on a grid.  When you fire the tank cannon or the plane's missle and they reach their final targets in a very realistic way.
